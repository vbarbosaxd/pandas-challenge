# Pandas Challenge

## Project Overview
In this project, I used the Pandas library and Jupyter Lab to analyze the data of a fictional fantasy game called Heroes of Pymoli. Each section had a final dataframe that summarized the ouput of the different calculations performed.

## Analyses Performed
The Jupyter script contains the following:

* Player Count
* Purchasing Analysis
* Gender Demographics
* Purchasing Analysis by Gender
* Age Demographics
* Purchasing Analysis by Age
* Top Spenders
* Most Popular Items
* Most Profitable Items

A word document was also added separately that contains the description of three trends that were observed based on the data analysis.
